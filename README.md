It is based on the `qualcommax-6.1-nss-wifi` branch from [qosmio/openwrt-ipq](https://github.com/qosmio/openwrt-ipq/tree/qualcommax-6.1-nss-wifi) and draws inspiration from [rodriguezst/ipq807x-openwrt-builder](https://github.com/rodriguezst/ipq807x-openwrt-builder).

- **Comprehensive Wireless Protocol Support** with `wpad-mbedtls` (Full).
- Build with `CONFIG_TARGET_OPTIMIZATION="-O3 -pipe -mcpu=cortex-a53+crc+crypto"; CONFIG_USE_LTO=y; CONFIG_USE_MOLD=y; CONFIG_ZLIB_OPTIMIZE_SPEED=y` for higher Performance.
